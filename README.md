# Ping Time Graph Plotter

This Python script reads ping data from a text file and generates a line graph visualizing the ping times.  The graph is saved as a PNG image.

## Usage

1.  **Save the script:** Save the Python code as `ping_plotter.py`.
2.  **Create ping data file:** Create a text file named `ping_data.txt` (or specify your filename in the script) and paste your ping data into it.  The data should be in a format similar to:

    ```
    Reply from 169.1.1.1: bytes=32 time=4ms TTL=53
    Reply from 169.1.1.1: bytes=32 time=5ms TTL=53
    ...
    ```

3.  **Run the script:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the files, and execute:

    ```bash
    python ping_plotter.py
    ```

4.  **View the graph:** The generated graph will be saved as `ping_graph.png` in the same directory.

## Dependencies

*   Python 3
*   `matplotlib`

    Install `matplotlib` using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install matplotlib
    ```

## Example

The script will read the ping times from `ping_data.txt`, create a graph showing the fluctuations in ping time, and save it as `ping_graph.png`.
